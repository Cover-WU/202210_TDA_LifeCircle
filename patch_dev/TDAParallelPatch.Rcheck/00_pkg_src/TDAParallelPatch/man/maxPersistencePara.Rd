\description{
The same function detecting maximal persistence as that of \code{TDA} package. In the function multiple computation kernel would be opened and parallel computation will be conducted using all of them.
}
\details{
This function is the parallel version of the TDA::maxPersistence
for the parallel computation of the parameter.
}
